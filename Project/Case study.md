Title: Employee Management

Case: There is a need to prepare a class called Employee with data as below

Empid
Ename
Sal
Deptno

Need to develop functions called Add Emp() and Display Emp() While accepting the data these are the important validation to be taken care
Need accept the data at command prompt
Like empid must be of 3 digits or more and it should be unique
All the names covert to upper case even if it is in lower case enter by end user
Sal should be more then 3000
Deptno must be 10 or 20 or 30
All the employees added should be added into a file called emp.txt

There is need to create a function called Separate Data
This will separate the data in Emp.txt into three different files as
emp_10.txt with all the employees working in deptno 10,mp_20.txt with all working in dept 20 and
emp_30.txt with deptno 30 employees. For better performance we should user lists.
There function call should be menu driven
1. Add emp
2. Display emp 
3. Separate data
4 Exit
